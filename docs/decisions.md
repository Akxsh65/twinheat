# Decisions log

Format: decision, date, rationale, who must confirm. Entries here are the record that CLAUDE.md §17
points to. Changing CLAUDE.md itself needs a PR plus a line in this file.

## D1 · How H6 is judged

- **Decision (2026-10-24):** H6 is judged at τ_v = 0.1 K, counting the pointwise certificate (Lemma 2c).
- **Why:** matches H6 as written in CLAUDE.md §11.4. The 50 % bar at 0.1 K is flagged there as at risk;
  if it fails, the fallback is the pointwise variant, keeping Lemma 2 for CG-2.
- **Owners to confirm:** N + M. Must be final before E13.

## D2 · Fixed parameters of the design task

Open. Owner M, due week 2. Placeholders live in `config/design_task.yaml` until then.

## D3 · Outer-layer G_l dielectric term

- **Decision (2026-10-24):** the missing outer dielectric term is 0, as written in CLAUDE.md §7.2.
- **Implementation:** config flag `outer_dielectric_term: "zero"`, so another convention can be added
  later without touching callers.
- **Owner to confirm:** N.

## D4 · Frozen gate hyperparameters

Open. Owner M, due week 6. Goes to `experiments/configs/frozen.yaml`.

## D5 · Week-3 go/no-go outcome

Open. Owners N + M, due week 3 (exact solve ≥ 0.3 s keeps 256² × 4 layers).

## D6 · Week-1 start date

- **Decision (2026-10-24):** week 1 is the week of Monday 19 October 2026. Today (24 Oct) is its last day.
- **Consequence:** week 3 is 2 to 8 November, and the week-12 end is 10 January 2027.
- **Owners to confirm:** all three.

## Other decisions

- **GPU access (2026-10-24):** Kaggle and Colab runs of `scripts/check_gpu.py` are skipped for now, since
  college GPU access may be available. One Kaggle 2×T4 run is on record in `docs/compute.md`.
